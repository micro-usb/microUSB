# A Use-Case-and-Semantics-Based Approach to Identifying Microservices in Legacy Monolithic Web Applications 

## Subject web applications 
### [JPetStore2](https://github.com/KimJongSung/jPetStore)

It is a full web application in the form of a pet store, showcasing the structure of an e-commerce platform, built on Spring 3 and MyBatis 2.

### [JPetStore6](https://github.com/mybatis/jpetstore-6)

JPetStore6 is another version of JPetStore2, built with MyBatis 3, Spring 5, and Stripes.

### [PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)

PetClinic is a sample application by SpringSource for the Spring Framework, designed to manage pet and veterinarian information, with both original and Thymeleaf-enabled versions.

### [ShoppingApp](https://github.com/manhduydl/Shopping-web-Jsp-Servlet)

ShoppingApp is a full web application built with Servlet and JSP, without using AJAX.

### [DayTrader](https://github.com/WASdev/sample.daytrader7)

DayTrader 7 is an online stock trading system based on Java EE 7, using JSF, EJB, and JDBC.

## Project structure 

### Ground truths 
To evaluate the proposed technique's performance, a ground truth for each subject web application is required. The ground truth is generated by web application experts.

### Baselines 
Our approach is compared with the following four baselines presented below. 
This folder contains the identification results for each baseline.

  - ### **Study [2]** 

### Model 
This folder contains the models used in our approach for identifying microservices. Each model reflects specific information about the web application.
- ### Behavioral 
  The behavior model represents the execution status of components for each use case. The execution status is represented by a value of either 0 or 1.
- ### Semantic 
  The semantic model is a collection of vectors that represent the meanings of components. The proposed approach analyzes the semantics of each component using only its name.
- ### Hybrid
  The Hybrid model, which combines the Behavioral model and the Semantic model, is the final model used in our approach.

### Results
This folder includes the results used in the Evaluation section.
